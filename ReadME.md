### REASON I CHOOSE PAYONEER 
1) Pakistan is no.3 on top freelance markets & it's the freelance market is growing very fast. Living & working here in the Information Technology field is not easy, as we always face issues with the payment transfer from other countries or clients because PayPal is ban here, SO Payoneer solves all our problems from Client/company payments to any money transfer digital using fingertips.


1) Payoneer supports over 200 countries with 150 local currencies. The financial payment service gives you the ability to directly withdraw funds with a debit card, as well as send and receive funds domestically and internationally, including using local bank transfer.

2) The prepaid Mastercard (not Visa) the brand issues facilitates transferring funds. It can be used as a debit card for any type of transaction, including e-commerce. Payments are sent to Payoneer Mastercard, rather than going into your online account (and then transferring to a local bank account).

3) This means less of a hassle if you need to acquire funds quickly. The card can be used at any ATM in the world but has a maximum daily limit of $2,500. According to the fee structure, they will also charge you an average of 1% of the transaction in foreign exchange fees.

Payoneer has a help desk with a customer support system and a collection of resources to build your knowledge base. The company has offices in multiple countries and is available via email, phone, and live chat.

### Who Needs a Payoneer Account and Why
Firsts things first, you have to figure out whether this very payment method is for you. So who would benefit from having a Payoneer account? Well, these are the following groups of people:

- Freelancers:
- Entrepreneurs;
- People who travel a lot;

### Everything You Need to Know about Payoneer Card
Payoneer card is a plastic card, just like the one you’ve got from your local bank, which can be used for withdrawing cash from ATMs, online shopping, paying by card in restaurants, cafés, cinemas, shops, and pretty much anything else you use your regular card for.

You can order a card after you received the first money transaction on your Payoneer account. The card will be sent to you by mail and this service is completely free. Usually, the delivery takes about 1-2 weeks.

If the card does not arrive for a long time, you can contact the support service and clarify the status of the sending. If for some reason the card is lost, it will be sent to you again. Until you activate the card in your account, this is a useless piece of plastic, so don’t worry if it gets lost.

While getting a card is completely free, you’ll have to pay for its service, which is $ 29.95 per year. However, getting a card is not a must for everybody, so you can use the service without a card. For instance, you can withdraw up to $10,000 per one transaction directly to your local bank card. Moreover, many banks do not take any commission fees for these transactions. So you can avoid paying the cost of card services, and you will only pay a fee for the transfer (if there is any). Though keep in mind that some features are available only for the cardholders.
